# This test was built quickly to reproduce GH#130 - the out of memory error.
# It's not set up to be run on any workstation, as it expects a particular log in
# You will need to edit the email and password submitted for log in below.
#
# To run this test, you will need to have the selenium-client gem and you will
# need to have an instance of Laika running on localhost:3000.  You will also need
# to have loaded the default data, and you will have to have added at least one
# test plan.
# 
# XXX It is best to use a new inspection with a single Display and Format test.
# If you have other test plans (such as XDS Provide and Register) which have Execute
# links, the test will try to execute those by mistake, and fail.
#
# Run:
#
# jruby -S rake selenium:rc:start
#
# to start up a selenium server instance
#
# Then run:
#
# ruby test/selenium/heap_overflow_test.rb
#
# Note, I haven't tried this with jruby - I don't know if there is a selenium-client
# gem for jruby, though there probably is.
#
# This test assumes a 500MB heap.
