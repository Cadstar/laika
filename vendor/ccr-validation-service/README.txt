To enable CCR validation, unpack a copy of Steven Waldren's CCR ValidationService (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccrvalidator/) in this directory.
You will also need to obtain a copy of the CCR xsd from ASTM (see the INSTALL.rdoc for details), and overwrite the placeholder CCRV1.xsd in the WEB-INF/classes/org/openhealthdata/validation/ directory in order for the CCR ValidationService to work.
